Each dedicated device using scopeosc should have it's own unique UID. As such we agree ranges of UIDs per developer to avoid conflicts. These are the agreed ranges:

- 0 - 9999 - BCModular (Simon Russell and Will Ellis): http://bcmodular.co.uk/
- 10000-19999 - Ocean Swift (Faxi Nadu): http://oceanswift.net/
- 90000-99999 - CWModular (Roy Thinnes): http://cwmodular.org/
